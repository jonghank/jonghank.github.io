== Announcements
- Zoom meeting ID: [https://inha-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/96706656431?pwd=b1NGZld6WnhmbEN1amhEbUZFaTBLdz09 967 0665 6431] 
- Welcome to ASE7030: Convex optimization.
~~~

== Course Info.

*Course descriptions* 
- The course covers a wide range of engineering application problems that can be solved via convex optimization. With minimal contents on optimization theories, this course will focus on problem formulation techniques that transforms the real-life engineering problems into mathematical optimization problems. The students will work on numerical experiments from a wide variety of engineering and other disciplines, including signal processing, control, finances, and machine learning.

*Lectures* 
- Mon\/Wed 15:00-16:15 (Rm.206 @aerospace campus)

*Office hours*
- Thr/Fri 15:00-16:00 (Rm.507 @aerospace campus)

*Prerequisites* 
- Linear algebra and statistics
- Prior exposure to numerical computation (Python or others)

*Reference textbooks* \n
- There are no required textbooks.
- [http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/ Convex optimization]
by Boyd and Vandenberghe will be a useful reference.

*Grading policy*
- Homework assignments (50\%)
- Final presentation (50\%)
