~~~
== Announcements
- Welcome to ASE7030: Convex optimization.
~~~

== Course Info.

*Course descriptions* 
- The course covers a wide range of engineering application problems that can be solved via convex optimization. With minimal contents on optimization theories, this course will focus on problem formulation techniques that transforms the real-life engineering problems into mathematical optimization problems. The students will work on numerical experiments from a wide variety of engineering and other disciplines, including signal processing, control, finances, and machine learning.

*Lectures* 
- Tue\/Thr 15:00-16:15 (Rm.215 @aerospace campus)

*Office hours*
- JHK: Tue\/Thr 16:30-18:00 (Rm.507), or by appointments.

*Prerequisites* 
- Linear algebra and statistics
- Prior exposure to numerical computation (Python or others)

*Reference textbooks* \n
- There are no required textbooks.
- [http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/ Convex optimization]
by Boyd and Vandenberghe will be a useful reference.

*Grading policy*
- Homework assignments (50\%)
- Class participation (50\%)
