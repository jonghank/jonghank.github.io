== Course Info.

*Course descriptions* 

- This course covers elementary computational techniques for solving mathematical problems in electrical and electronic engineering. Students will use high level programming languages to formulate, interpret and analyze practical real-world problems encountered at a wide variety of engineering disciplines. Covered topics include but not limited to differential equations, linear algebra, probability, Fourier transform, introductory machine learning and artificial intelligence.

*Lectures* 
- Wed 13:30-16:30 (Callab-B01)

*Office hours*
- JHK: Wed 16:30-18:00 (Rm.516), or by appointments if you cannot meet them.
- TA: By appointments (Rm.508)

*Prerequisites* 
- Previous exposure to programming languages (Python or others).

*Reference textbooks* \n
- There are no required textbooks.

*Grading policy*
- Final projects (40%)
- Midterm exam (30%)
- Homework assignments and class participation (30%)
